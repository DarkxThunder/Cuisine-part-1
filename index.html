                    Pakistani cuisine(Urdu: پاکستانی پکوان, romanized: pākistānī pakwān) can be characterized as a blend of regional cooking styles and flavours from across South, Central and West Asia.
                    Pakistani cuisine is influenced by Persian, Indian, and Arab cuisine.
                    The cuisine of Pakistan also maintains certain Mughal influences within its recipes and cooking techniques.
                    Pakistan's ethnic and cultural diversity, diverse climates, geographical environments, and availability of different produce lead to diverse regional cuisines.
